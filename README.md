# Kernel-Level Thread Library

This project implements a basic kernel-level thread library that provides foundational threading functionality within a custom or educational operating system kernel. It focuses on lightweight thread creation, context switching, and cooperative or preemptive scheduling.

## Features

- Low-level thread creation and termination
- Context switching via stack and register management
- Preemptive and/or cooperative scheduling support
- Basic synchronization primitives (e.g., locks, condition variables)
- Minimal dependencies for educational OS environments
